Project Overview:- 
Personal Finance Tracker
The Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their financial transactions by recording both income and expenses, categorizing them, and calculating the net balance. The app stores the transaction data using the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that the data persists even after the browser is closed.

Key Features:-
Add Transactions: Users can enter a description, amount (positive for income, negative for expenses), and select a category for the transaction. This data is stored and displayed in real-time.
Transaction List: A dynamically generated list of all transactions is displayed, along with the option to delete individual transactions.
Income and Expense Calculation: The app automatically calculates the total income, total expenses, and net balance based on the transactions entered.
Persistent Storage: Transactions are saved in the browser’s localStorage, so they persist across sessions without the need for an external database.
Responsive Design: The user interface is simple, clean, and responsive, ensuring that it works well across different devices.

How It Works:-
User Input: The user enters details of a transaction through a form, which includes fields for a description, amount, and category.
Data Storage: The transaction is stored in localStorage as a JSON object, allowing data to persist between browser sessions.
Real-Time Updates: As transactions are added or removed, the total income, total expenses, and net balance are recalculated and displayed in real time.
User Interaction: Users can delete transactions, and the app updates the display and recalculates totals accordingly.

Project Structure:-
HTML: Provides the structure for the input form and transaction list.
CSS: Styles the page to ensure a modern, user-friendly interface with a responsive layout.
JavaScript: Handles all interactions, including adding transactions, updating the totals, and managing data in localStorage.

Sample Use Case:-
A user earns a salary of $1000 and spends $200 on food and $100 on entertainment. The app will calculate the total income as $1000, total expenses as $300, and net balance as $700, displaying all these values dynamically.

Future Enhancements:-
Graphical Reports: Adding charts or graphs to visually represent spending habits.
Filter Options: Adding the ability to filter transactions by date or category.
Date Support: Including the date for each transaction and providing insights over time (e.g., monthly reports).
Export Data: Allowing users to export their transaction data in a CSV or Excel format for further analysis.

Conclusion:-
The Personal Finance Tracker is an effective, lightweight tool for managing day-to-day personal finances. It offers a clear view of income, expenses, and savings, with a simple interface that makes financial tracking accessible to users of all technical levels. With a few enhancements, it has the potential to grow into a more robust personal finance management system.
